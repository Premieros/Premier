# MASTER LOG 2

## Mandatory development rules
- Development branch: `development/master-log2`. Never develop directly on `main`.
- Baseline must remain recoverable; changes are incremental and reversible.
- Existing design is the baseline. Improve behavior without redesigning completed UI unless explicitly required.
- Every visible control/button must have a real, independently testable action; functionality must not depend on visual position.
- Every phase follows: inspect -> implement -> unit/integration/E2E test -> CI -> fix -> retest -> document -> close.
- A phase cannot close unless all prior phases still pass regression checks.
- Never weaken, delete, skip, or rewrite assertions merely to obtain green CI.
- No fake data or fake success paths in production code. CI-only stubs must remain CI-only.
- Database changes use additive migrations; never edit an applied migration.
- Keep data access behind the project's API boundaries and preserve RLS/RBAC.
- Optimize for speed with lazy loading, pagination, bounded queries, memoization, and minimal rerenders; never trade correctness/security for speed.
- Supabase remains the existing project/environment unless explicit approval is given for a separate project/branch.

## Unified screen capabilities
All operational list/detail screens should use reusable controls for:
- branch selection and branch-aware filtering
- date/range filters, search, sorting, grouping
- configurable columns and multiple saved views
- import/upload and export/download
- print where operationally appropriate
- persisted user preferences

Example: Orders can be viewed by order/invoice number, customer, products, branch, date, status, payment, totals, etc. These are reusable capabilities, not one-off screens.

## Phase reporting rule
At every phase closure report exactly:
- DONE: completed and verified items.
- REMAINING: items not yet completed.
- BLOCKED/RISKS: blockers or risks, with reason.
- EVIDENCE: commit/CI/test evidence.
- NEXT: the next phase or slice only after the gate passes.

## Current execution
Baseline verification passed on the current development branch. POS Core is the active phase. The next implementation must first locate the actual current POS source path from the repository tree before changing code; never infer a path from stale documentation.
